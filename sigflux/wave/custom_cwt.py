def cwt(data, wavelet, widths):
    """
    Continuous wavelet transform.

    Performs a continuous wavelet transform on `data`,
    using the `wavelet` function. A CWT performs a convolution
    with `data` using the `wavelet` function, which is characterized
    by a width parameter and length parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : (N,) ndarray
        data on which to perform the transform.
    wavelet : function
        Wavelet function, which should take 2 arguments.
        The first argument is the number of points that the returned vector
        will have (len(wavelet(length,width)) == length).
        The second is a width parameter, defining the size of the wavelet
        (e.g. standard deviation of a gaussian). See `ricker`, which
        satisfies these requirements.
    widths : (M,) sequence
        Widths to use for transform.

    Returns
    -------
    cwt: (M, N) ndarray
        Will have shape of (len(widths), len(data)).

    Notes
